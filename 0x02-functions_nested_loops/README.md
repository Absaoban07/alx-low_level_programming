FUNCTION OF EACH TASK
0._PUTCHAR: this program prints "_putchar" followed by a new line.

1-alphabet: When this function is compiled and run, It will print all the letters of the english alphabet in lowercase to the terminal followed by a newline.

2-print_alphabet_X10:When this function is compiled and run, It will print all the letters of the english alphabet (in lowercase) to the terminal followed by a newline each time.

3-islower: When this function is called with a character being passed as an argument, It will determine if the character is a lowercase character or not and return either 1 (if it is a lowercase) or 0 (If it is not a lowercase).

4-isalpha: When this function is called with a character being passed into it as an argument, the function will determine if the character is a letter of the english alphabet. If the character is a letter of the english alphabet, the function returns 1 (true). If not, the function returns 0 (false).

5-sign: When this function is called with an integer number passed to it as an argument, then the function determines the sign of the number and prints it and then returns a code to designate which kind of number. i.e If the number is greater than zero, the function prints + and returns 1. If equal to zero, the functions prints 0 and returns 0. If less than zero, the functions prints - and returns -1.

6-abs:The moment this function is compiled and run, the function takes a number as it's argument and the function returns the absolute value of the integer that is passed into it as it's parameter. The absolute value for a number n is defined for n > 0 as n and n < 0 as -n where -n is the sign inversion of the number n.

7-print_last_digit: When  this program  is compileand run  the function will take a number n as it's argument Then the function will print the last digit of n to the terminal and return same. 

8-24_hours: Looking at its name we ought to have understand that this is going to prints every minutes of a day. Thus, it prints jack bauer's minutes for a 24-hour day to the terminal starting from 00:00 and ending at 23:59.

9-times_table: When this program is compiled and run, it will print a 9x9 multiplication table to the terminal.

10-add: This program will take two integers as an argument and return the sum of these integers.

11-print_to_98: in this program we  the function print_to_98 will take an integer value as an argument and will start counting from that point until it gets the value 98. If the integer supplied is greater than 98, the function begins to count down to 98. If the integer supplied is less than 98, the function counts up to 98. It prints to the terminal as it counts.
